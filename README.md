In Haunted, your objective is to save you wife but not from ghosts but from yourself. You play as a soldier who has come back home but is still haunted by his memories of war. You have to fight with ghosts from past while not harming you family. 
The movement is controlled by keyboard and aiming is by the mouse. You can also shift to dash in later stages in the game. When you can an enemy, a ghost starts following you and when it reaches you, you lose control.
As the you progress, enemies become more aggressive and shoot more bullets. Also, the ghost becomes faster. Smaller enemies can create bigger ones when collided and pick ups, if you donâ€™t pick them in time, become enemies.
